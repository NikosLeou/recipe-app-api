[flake8]

#this tells flake8 to exclude the following from linting.
#migrations are auto-generated by django, so we dont need to lint those
#cache files are also autogenerated by python
#manage.py is a file that comes with django
#setting.py also contains lines mostly generated by django
# we generally only want to lint things we create
exclude = 
        migrations, 
        __pycache__,
        manage.py,
        settings.py


# once we save this, we run the linting tool by going to the terminal and run:
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"
# if we don't have anything returned, it means we are good.
